# **GeekJedi E-commerce** 👩‍💻

### ℹ️ About this challenge:

This challenge was proposed by Oracle ONE Next Education + Alura. It's the second challenge of Front-End course.

### ✏️ About the project:

The purpose of this challenge is to create an e-commerce. I chose to make a different, fun and super geek theme: Star Wars.
The requirements for the challenge were:
  * Functional login button;
  * A page with all the products and their information;
  * A footer with a functional contact form (in this one, for better visual organization, I decided to put the contact form inside the "contact" page that can be found in the footer);
  * An admin menu, accessible through login, where you can add, edit and remove products (I'm still working on the functionality of this page with CRUD);
  * Product description page (all products contain their own page with their respective descriptions, including a div with similar products);

### 💻Technologies used:

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript

### 📱Responsiveness:

This e-commerce is responsible in all devices and can be used on mobiles, tablets and computer.

### ⭐Extra:

The first version of the site was created with a black background. However, for a better view, according to the user's taste, I decided to add a darkmode button, where the user can choose which theme is best for him.
